<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distribution Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Liquid immersed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distribution transformers are divided into two main types: dry-type transformers and liquid-immersed transformers. Dry-type transformers use air to cool the windings, making them safer for indoor installations and requiring less maintenance. Liquid-immersed transformers use oil or other liquids to cool the windings, allowing for higher power capacities and efficiencies. Both types are crucial in efficiently distributing electricity from power plants to homes and businesses. The choice of transformer type depends on factors such as installation location, power capacity, and maintenance requirements.</p></p>
