<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical Biometry Market Types include Contact Type and Non-contact Type devices used for measuring ocular parameters for intraocular lens calculations. Contact Type devices require direct contact with the patient's eye for measurements, while Non-contact Type devices achieve the same without physical contact. Contact Type devices offer higher accuracy due to direct measurement, while Non-contact Type devices are more comfortable for the patient and reduce the risk of infection transmission. Both types are essential in the field of ophthalmology for precise measurements and successful cataract surgeries.</p></p>
