<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Sandblasting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Wet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Manual sandblasting machines can be classified into two main types: dry and wet. In dry sandblasting, abrasive material is propelled onto the surface to be cleaned or treated using compressed air. This method is more commonly used and is suitable for removing tough deposits and rust. On the other hand, wet sandblasting involves mixing water with the abrasive material before propelling it onto the surface. This method is less abrasive and produces less dust, making it suitable for delicate surfaces or environments where dust control is a concern.</p></p>
