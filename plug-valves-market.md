<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plug Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Lubricated</li><li>Lubricated Plug Valve</li><li>Eccentric Plug Valve</li><li>Expanding Plug Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plug valves can be categorized into various types based on their functionality. Non-lubricated plug valves are designed to operate without any external lubrication, reducing maintenance requirements. Lubricated plug valves utilize a lubricant to reduce friction and ensure smooth operation. Eccentric plug valves have an off-center plug, allowing for tight shut-off even in high-pressure applications. Expanding plug valves feature a plug that expands into the flow passage, providing a tight seal and enhancing control over flow rate. Each type offers unique advantages for different industrial applications.</p></p>
