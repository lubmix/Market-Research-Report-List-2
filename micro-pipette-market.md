<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro Pipette Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Air Cushion</li><li>Without Air Cushion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Micro pipettes are precision instruments used in laboratories for accurately measuring and transferring small volumes of liquids. There are two main types in the market: with air cushion and without air cushion. Pipettes with air cushion have a small bubble of air that reduces the risk of liquid entering the pipette and damaging the internal components. On the other hand, pipettes without air cushion rely on a different mechanism to prevent liquid from entering the pipette. Both types are commonly used in various scientific fields for their accuracy and consistency in measuring liquid volumes.</p></p>
