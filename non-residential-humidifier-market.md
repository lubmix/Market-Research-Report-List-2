<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-residential Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adiabatic</li><li>Isothermal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-residential humidifiers can be classified into two main types: adiabatic and isothermal. Adiabatic humidifiers work by using the principle of adiabatic cooling to add moisture to the air without changing its temperature. Isothermal humidifiers, on the other hand, add moisture to the air while maintaining a constant temperature, preventing any cooling effect. Adiabatic humidifiers are more energy-efficient but may lead to slightly lower humidity levels compared to isothermal humidifiers. Both types are used in commercial and industrial settings to maintain optimal humidity levels.</p></p>
