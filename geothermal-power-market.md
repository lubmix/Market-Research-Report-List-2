<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power market consists of three main types of power stations. Dry steam stations utilize steam directly from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate electricity. Flash steam power stations use hot water from geothermal reservoirs to produce steam that turns turbines. Binary cycle stations transfer heat from geothermal water to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then vaporizes and drives turbines. Each type of station harnesses geothermal energy in a different way to generate clean and sustainable power.</p></p>
